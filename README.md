# MOMentum: Monthly Subscription Box for Busy Moms

## Description
MOMentum is a monthly subscription box designed to cater to the health and well-being of busy moms. It offers a curated selection of workout videos, small workout tools/devices, snacks, and other goodies that support and empower moms to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite their hectic schedules.

## Motivation
The motivation behind MOMentum was to address the specific challenges faced by moms in prioritizing their health and fitness. Juggling multiple responsibilities, moms often find it challenging to dedicate time and resources to their well-being. This subscription box aims to provide a convenient and accessible solution, delivering a range of wellness products directly to their doorstep.

## Problem Solving
MOMentum solves the problem of time constraints and lack of access to fitness resources for busy moms. By providing a monthly subscription service, it eliminates the need for moms to research and source fitness products and resources on their own. MOMentum delivers carefully selected items that cater to their unique needs, making it easier for them to incorporate exercise and self-care into their routines.

## Learning Experience
During the development of MOMentum, we gained valuable insights into integrating various technologies and frameworks to create a seamless user experience. We learned how to leverage React for building a dynamic and responsive front-end interface. Additionally, we successfully implemented GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server for efficient data retrieval and management. Integrating MongoDB with the Mongoose ODM allowed us to store and manipulate data securely. We also incorporated authentication using JWT to protect sensitive user information.
